# Detection-of-Anorexia-over-social-media-platform
Here, using various machine learning framework, detection of Anorexia has been done. The motivation behind the task is that
if anorexic symptoms are properly identified on time, then, professionals could intervene before anorexia progresses. The objective of this is to develop effective machine learning frameworks to detect the signs of anorexia using a given corpus. Besides using only conventional machine learning techniques, UMLS features have also been used used to extract the semantics that correspond to Anorexia. We have used Precision, Recall and F-measure as our evaluation measure of the proposed framework.
